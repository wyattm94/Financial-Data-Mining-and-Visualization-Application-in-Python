# Financial-Data-Mining-and-Visualization-Application-in-Python
The aim of this project was to develop an application similiar to the industry standard Bloomberg Data Terminal products with respect to both data and visual analysis, but differ in that it could be run from any local computer and cost nothing to the user. Over roughly 2 years I developed a custom API framework for mining financial data from public resources, processing/cleaning that data and storing it locally in any system running the API. I implemented advanced multi-threaded protocols with custom request building and parsing to ensure seemless operation across not only multiple asset classes but also mutliple types of available market data. I integrated this API framework with my own custom graphics framework that wrapped around the Python Dash module graphical toolset. The final product was an interactive web-based application for using the API to collect and load data for use in conducting an array of visualization analyses; an application that costs nothing to use.
